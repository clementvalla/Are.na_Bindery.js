# Are.na_Bindery.js
Make books with your Are.na channels

Uses Bindery.js by Evan Brooks:
https://github.com/evnbr/bindery



## Using
1. Download Are.na_Bindery.js
2. Download you Are.na Channel as HTML
3. unzip and place your channel in the "channels" folder
4. open your channel's index.html file
5. copy code from code_snippets.html into the index.html file
6. open your index.html file in your browser (so far works best on chrome)
7. ctrl+p or print in browser
8. save as pdf



## Issues
Right now the CSS is pretty ugly. Are.na provides really stripped down HTML so we're using a lot of :nth-child(x) pseudo-selectors for formatting, and this doesn' produce the cleanest results.

Oh, and I don't use git or github a lot so not sure what the best practice is for including Evan's Bindery.js library here.
